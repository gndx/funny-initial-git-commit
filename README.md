# funny-commit

Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a “git init” there is technically nothing there...

## Install

```npm
npm install -g funny-commit
```

## Usage

```bash
funny-commit
```

## Example
```bash
git add -A
funny-commit | git commit -F -
```

## Commands
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Command</th>
          <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>funny-commit</td>
          <td>Print a funny commit to use.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>funny-commit -v | --version</td>
          <td>Print funny-commit version.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>funny-commit -h | --help</td>
          <td>Print funny-commit manual.</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
